**Features:**

1. Search auto-completion
1. High performance (it generates an offline search index!)
1. Text highlighting support
1. Target results within a specific version, page and heading section

## How search works

Docbase builds an offline search index and stores it in a file called ``search-index.json``. Every time there is a change in documentation, this file is updated by docbase.

The docbase search view uses typeahead.js for building the search view.
