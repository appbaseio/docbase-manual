## Support for versions

Docbase can read all .md files from a root directory. Additionally, files can be organized into sub-directories to denote:
1. multiple versions (like v1.0, v1.1 or EN, ES, PT) and
2. organize files into topics.

Docbase infers the documentation layout, or one can be optionally provided in the configuration.
