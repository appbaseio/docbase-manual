# Versions

Docbase is a full-featured documentation hub for .md projects of all size. It comes with a versioning feature baked right in.

## Switcher

Documentation evolves over time and docbase allows creating versions to reflect this evolution.

Version switcher also works with internationalization, say you want to show language options like EN, ES, PT.

## Search

Searching for terms shows results filtered by versions.

## How to create versions

```
|__ root
|   |__ path
|       |__ v1
|       |   |__ topic1
|       |       |__ page.md
|       |       |__ foo.md
|       |__ v2
|           |__ ...
```

For reading .md, docbase takes the ``root`` and a relative ``path`` from root which forms the location from where docbase starts reading the .md files.

**versions** are directories inside the ``root/path`` location. For creating a new version, you create a new directory.

You can read more about the directory structure that docbase confirms to here.
